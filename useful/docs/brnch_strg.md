# Terraform Repository Branching Strategy

A good branching strategy for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform is crucial for managing and evolving infrastructure with stability, speed, and efficiency. 

This document outlines the branching strategy for managing the Terraform codebase responsible for provisioning and managing our infrastructure. The strategy is designed to ensure stability, efficiency, and collaboration across the teams.

This guide provides an overview of best practices for managing infrastructure using a trunk-based strategy with Terraform. The trunk-based development approach simplifies version control workflows, ensuring a streamlined process for integrating changes into the infrastructure codebase.

Strategy Overview: Trunk-Based Development
Trunk-based development involves direct commits to a single, central branch (typically named main or master). This approach minimizes complexity, reduces merge conflicts, and supports continuous integration practices.

Setting Up the Environment
Main Branch: The main branch acts as the central line of development and should reflect the current state of production infrastructure.


#### Implementing Changes
**Change Requests**: Changes start as requests or tasks, clearly describing the intended modifications or new features.
Local Development: Developers should pull the latest version of the main branch and create a local working copy for changes. Small, frequent commits are encouraged to keep changes manageable and traceable.
Testing and Validation: Changes should be thoroughly tested locally using Terraform's plan and apply commands. Incorporating automated testing and validation into the workflow ensures reliability.
Code Review: Changes should be reviewed through pull requests or merge requests, even in a trunk-based model, to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices. Peer reviews help catch issues and maintain standards.


#### Benefits of Trunk-Based Development
Quick Integration: Facilitates faster integration and deployment of changes.
Simplicity: Maintains a single source of truth in the codebase, simplifying the development process and reducing overhead.
Stability: Continuous integration and testing ensure that only well-vetted changes make it to production, maintaining the stability and reliability of the infrastructure.
