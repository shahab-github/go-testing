# Managing Multiple Environments with Terraform

When using Terraform to manage infrastructure, it is common to have multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production. Each environment may have its own set of resources and configurations.

## Workspace-per-Environment Strategy

The **Workspace-per-Environment** strategy in Terraform Enterprise is a widely adopted approach for managing infrastructure across different stages of the development lifecycle, such as development, testing, staging, and production. This strategy involves creating a dedicated workspace for each environment, ensuring a clear separation and isolation of resources, state files, and configurations. 

In Terraform, a workspace contains everything Terraform needs to manage a given collection of infrastructure resources, including configuration files, state data, variables, and credentials. Each workspace is effectively an isolated environment for Terraform operations.

It is recommended to have a seperate workspace for each of your environments. For example, you might have a dev workspace for development, a test workspace for testing, a stage workspace for staging, and a prod workspace for production. Each workspace acts as an isolated environment for managing a set of infrastructure resources. Each workspace maintains its own state, ensuring that operations in one environment do not impact another. This is crucial for preventing unintended changes in production environments.

Version Control Integration: Each workspace is connected to your version control system (VCS), like GitHub. You can link all workspaces to the same repository but differentiate the environments using different directories, branches, or Terraform configurations within the repository.

Environment Configuration: In each workspace, you define environment-specific Terraform variables and secrets. These might include things like the size of compute instances, database passwords, or cloud provider credentials. Terraform Enterprise securely stores these values and injects them into Terraform runs within the workspace.

The **Workspace-per-Environment** strategy in Terraform Enterprise offers a robust and scalable approach to managing infrastructure across various stages of the development lifecycle. By dedicating separate workspaces to each environment, such as development, testing, staging, and production, we achieve clear separation and isolation of resources, configurations, and state files. This method enhances our operational security, simplifies state management, and aligns with best practices for infrastructure as code (IaC).
